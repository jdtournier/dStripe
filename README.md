Abstract: MRI scanner and sequence imperfections and advances in reconstruction and imaging techniques to increase motion robustness can lead to inter-slice intensity variations in Echo Planar Imaging. Leveraging deep convolutional neural networks as universal image filters, we present a data-driven method for the correction of acquisition artefacts that manifest as inter-slice inconsistencies, regardless of their origin. This technique can be applied to motion- and dropout-artefacted data by embedding it in a reconstruction pipeline. The network is trained in the absence of ground-truth data on, and finally applied to, the reconstructed multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging signal to produce a corrective slice intensity modulation field. This correction can be performed in either motion-corrected or scattered source-space. We focus on gaining control over the learned filter and the image data consistency via built-in spatial frequency and intensity constraints. The end product is a corrected image reconstructed from the original raw data, modulated by a multiplicative field that can be inspected and verified to match the expected features of the artefact. In-plane, the correction approximately preserves the contrast of the diffusion signal and throughout the image series, it reduces inter-slice inconsistencies within and across subjects without biasing the data. We apply our pipeline to enhance the super-resolution reconstruction of neonatal multi-shell high angular resolution data as acquired in the developing Human Connectome Project.

This repository is set up as a module to [MRtrix3](https://www.mrtrix.org/) and uses pytorch (tested with 0.4.1) and a number of other python packages (see [environment.yml](environment.yml)).

# Usage for anatomical-space inference

For ease of use, we recommend using Docker as outlined below. dStripe supports CPU-only and single and multi-GPU usage. In the usage examples, input and output data are located in `~/data` and mapped to `/data` inside the Docker container. This can be adjusted by modifying the command line option `--volume ~/data/:/data`.

## download or build image

### either pull from dockerhub 


```bash
docker pull maxpietsch/dstripe:1.1
```

**Note: If you use the dockerhub image, replace `dstripe` in the docker command line examples wih the full image name (`maxpietsch/dstripe:1.1`).**


### or build your own docker image 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:maxpietsch/dStripe.git dStripe
cd dStripe

docker image build \
  --file docker/Dockerfile \
  --tag dstripe \
  .
```

Make sure you have sufficient RAM! You might need to increase Docker's runtime memory ([macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#memory), [windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced)).

## show dwidestripe usage

The main command for inference is `dwidestripe`. The most basic usage is `dwidestripe dwi.mif field.mif`. To show all options simply run it without arguments:

```bash
docker run --rm dstripe dwidestripe
```

## dwidestripe ~/data/dwi.mif on the CPU (relatively slow)

```bash
docker run --rm --volume ~/data/:/data dstripe \
  dwidestripe /data/dwi.mif /data/mask.mif /data/dstripe_field.mif -device cpu
```

## dwidestripe ~/data/dwi.mif on the GPU

This should be much faster but requires the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html). Make sure `docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0-base nvidia-smi` shows your GPUs before proceeding.
  
For [GPU support](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/) add `--gpus all` and replace `-device cpu` with for instance `-device 0,1` for using the first two CUDA-capable GPUs listed by `nvidia-smi`.

```bash
docker run --rm --volume ~/data/:/data --gpus all dstripe \
  dwidestripe /data/dwi.mif /data/mask.mif /data/dstripe_field.mif -device 0,1
```

## apply dStripe field

```bash
docker run --rm --volume ~/data/:/data dstripe \
  mrcalc /data/dwi.mif /data/dstripe_field.mif -mult /data/dwi_destriped.mif
```
  
## use dStripe in singularity

Conversion of the Docker image to Singularity (thanks @cookpa!):
  
```bash
sudo singularity build dstripe.sif docker://maxpietsch/dstripe:1.1
```

Example Singularity runs with temporary data located in ~/data instead of the user's home directory:
```bash
#Â run on GPU 0 (--nv option required)
singularity run --no-home --nv -e -B ~/data:/data dstripe.sif dwidestripe /data/dwi.mif /data/mask.mif /data/dstripe_field.mif \
  -device 0 -scratch /data -config TmpFileDir /data 

# run on the CPU, limited to 4 threads:
singularity run --no-home -e -B ~/data:/data dstripe.sif dwidestripe /data/dwi.mif /data/mask.mif /data/dstripe_field.mif \
  -device cpu -nthreads 4 -scratch /data -config TmpFileDir /data
```
Note, if the CPU load is higher than expected, try restricting it via environment variables:
`singularity run --env MRTRIX_NTHREADS=1 --env OM_NUM_THREADS=1 --env MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 --env NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1 ...`

  
## versions:

- 1.1 upgraded `MRtrix3` from `3.0.1` to `3.0.3`. Respect number of threads in CPU code.
- 1.0.1 changes to facilitate Singularity conversion from Docker
- 1.0.0 as used for the neonatal dHCP data release 3.
